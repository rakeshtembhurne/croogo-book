# Faster Web Development with Croogo

## Why Started This Book

I have been developing CakePHP projects for more than 4 years now and I really love this framework. There are people who has some opinions about how other PHP frameworks are better than CakePHP. But the reason why I prefere CakePHP is the community, the company - CakeDC and the support for old versions.

The main reason I prefer CakePHP is the speed at which I can create things. I have built smaller as well as very complex and vast applications. And for the performance, there are always ways to enhance the speed.

Croogo is a CMS built on the top of CakePHP which is an excellent example of what type of applications can be developed with CakePHP. CakePHP is just a framework - collection of things. Croogo is a CMS, where most common things that most of the web applications need, are built in it.

## For whom this book is for?

This book is **mainly written for programmers** who have some sort of experience in CakePHP, or at least an PHP MVC framework.
